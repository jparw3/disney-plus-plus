## The Story

When my girlfriend and I were trying to watch Family Guy together on a Disney Plus group party, we found ourselves constantly needing to click the 'Continue' at the end of an episode. As a developer I knew that I could just make a chrome extension that would auto play for us. After reading the chrome extention docs and rewriting a few times, I finally had a working extention.

## How to use

1. Download the source code from this Github (I'm not paying for a chrome developer account).
2. In chrome, Click the 3 dots in the top left to open the menu > More tools > Extensions.
3. Toggle on Developer mode.
4. Drag and drop the folder into the extensions.
5. Open the extension and either choose a number of epsides to play, or tick the Continuous play checkbox and press 'Start Auti Playing'
6. Enjoy your show without needing to press continue every 22 minutes.
